          This is a page for me to showcase a lot of the stuff I have made in the past, but don't feel like writing a
          full article on.
          <br>
          <br>Some of these are older than others but I learned a lot from each and every single one of them.

        <h2>
          Got a minute
        </h2>
        <span><video width=75% height="315" controls src="/img/GAM.mp4"></span>
        <p>
          The first game I ever made in unity as part of the game mechanics course at DAE. It's a 2D platformer where
          you have a minute to get to the end. I leanred a whole lot just by messing around with Unity for this project
          and it still serves as a foundation for how I use the engine today. A lot of time was spent making the lights
          look cool and tuning the anvils.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Botanica
        </h2>
        <span><video width=75% height="315" controls src="/img/Botanica.mp4"></span>
        <p>
          The second part of the game mechanics course where we had to make a game in Unreal 4. What originally
          started as just trying to get plants with genetics to work turned into a playground for me to mess with
          mechanics, I eventually ended up with a whole 3D movement system, first person point and click controls, a
          dialogue system, vending machines, closet doors, and a robust plant system.

          Binding of Isaac
        </p>
        <span><video width=75% height="315" controls src="/img/BOI.mp4"></span>
        <p>
          A recreation of the binding of Isaac I made in C++ using SDL for programming 2 at DAE. It has fully working
          stats, bombs, items, pickups, enemies and a level generator. I'm still quite proud of the result but as one
          of
          my first big projects the codebase behind it is messy.

          Fmod Test
        </p>
        <span><video width=75% height="315" controls src="/img/FMOD.mp4"></span>
        <p>
          A smaller project where I spent a day learning how to implement Fmod into Unity for dynamic music (Music made
          by Voltriar von Fulchard which kindly made it for me.)

          Dual rasterizer
        </p>
        <span><img src="/img/DR.gif"></span>
        <p>
          Part of the graphics programming 1 course at DAE made in C++. This project consists of 2 big part, a software
          rasterizer and a hardware rasterizer using directX.

        <p>
          As part of the graphics programming 2 course at DAE we needed to make a game in Overlord, a propriatery engine
          using C++ we needed to add a render pipeline to.
        </p>

          Minigin
        </p>
        <p>
          In the programming 4 course we needed to make our own 2D engine basically from scratch and then recreate an
          arcade game with various gamemodes in that engine.

          Zombie AI

        <p>
          Exam for the gameplay programming course at DAE where we needed to create steering behaviours in C++.
