        <h2>
          Automation Roguelike
        </h2>
        <span><video width=75% height="315" controls src="/img/AR.mp4"></span>
        <p>
          A bigger game I'm currently working on for the group projects course at DAE. Usually this course is focused
          around working for a client but a few of the projects are student ones. This means me, another programmer and
          3 artists are helping out a indie game production student with a game. We intend to release it on steam in
          2024.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of my efforts have been going into the terrain generation, a robust combination of chunks using cellular
          automata and a custom system of connecting those chunks with mining areas and giving the player choices
          between them. The chunk inside of the chunk consists of 3 major layers, caverns, the main layer and pilars.
          Caverns and pillars are generated as 2 big repeating cellular automata maps allowing them to travel between
          chunks. The main layer is a smaller bit of cave generation with borders surrounding it so it doesn't clip into
          other chunks.
        </p>
        <span><img src="/img/Caves.gif"></span>
        <p>
          The placement works by having a starting chunks all the other chunks connect up to in the form of branches.
          The first chunk of a branch is always just one but afterwards the player gets a choice of two each time, both
          of which have a granteed finished path as long as the branch lenght. When the player picks a chunk it's branch
          becomes the main branch and the other gets deleted, then a new potential branch gets generated when the player
          is given a choice again.
        </p>
        <span><img src="/img/Choices.gif"></span>
        <p>
          When a branch if completed it solidifies merging all the meshes in each chunk to make it a lot more performant
          even when there's hundereds of them in play. The last chunk fo a branch gets counted as "exhausted" meaning it
          can never be used as a starting chunk, this is due to it having a permanent nest which would hidner mining.
          Whenever a starting chunk is can't generate any new chunks next to it it becomes echausted as well and the
          closest non exhausted chunk becomes the starting chunk and gets unsolidified. This system allows for a
          spiderweb like structure to the caves with a path to the center for the enemies to follow always being
          possible.

        <h2>
          NDS Port
        </h2>
        <span><img src="/img/NDSreal.jpg"></span>
        <p>
          Still in its very early stages, I'm working on porting NDS to an actual Nintendo DS using devkitARM.

        <h2>
          Point and click immersive sim
        </h2>
        <p>
          One of my personal projects, an immersive sim based on the control scheme I made for Botanica but ported over
          to Unity instead.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Space RTS
        </h2>
        <p>
          A 3D RTS using sparse voxel octrees and an improved version of my formation system to make a spaceship RTS,
          developent is slow due to DAE but I very much want to finish this one day.
