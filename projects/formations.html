          This is a project that aims to create unit formations for Real-Time Strategy games in unity. Made as part of
          the gameplay programming course at DAE.
          <br>
          <br>
          In most RTS games, players can create formations for their units. This is done by selecting a group of units
          and then assigning a formation to them. These allow players to organize their forces and position them for
          maximum effectiveness on a virtual battlefield.

          This project was created as part of the gameplay programming course at DAE. The primary focus of this course
          was to delve into the world of game AI, specifically covering topics like creating agent behaviours and
          implementing behaviour trees.
        </p>
        <p>
          Towards the end of the course, we were tasked with a free project, and I decided to explore unit formations
          (used in places like real-time strategy (RTS) games.) Essentially, players can select a group of units and
          arrange them in specific shapes or formations. My approach to implementing this in Unity was to define the
          mathematical equations for the desired shapes, create a list of target locations for each agent in the
          formation, and make those agents move towards those points. <b><a
              href="https://github.com/BasRuckebusch/Formations" target="_blank">You can find more detailed information
              in the
              GitHub repository in the readme file, which provides a better explanation.</a></b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Two shapes are implemented, circles and squares, each with unique characteristics and functionality. Users can
          easily manipulate these formations, moving them around or splitting them. I'm personally pleased with the
          control scheme, which turned out intuitive and user-friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had just learned how to use singletons at the time of making this project, which is responsible for their
          overuse in the project. While it still turned out well, I wished I had focused more on composition and design
          principles to make the codebase more robust and maintainable.
