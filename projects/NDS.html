          Hieda no Akyuu's Nocturnal Discordant Symposium (NDS for short) is a game made in 72 hours for the Touhou Fan
          Game Jam 11.
          It won first place in the Concept category, 6th place in Gameplay, and 9th place overall, out of 50 entries.

          I was the sole programmer on this project, collaborating with three other team members from different parts of
          the world.

          This project spawned because an American friend asked if I wished to join their game jam team.
          We had been discussing the idea of participating in a game jam together for over a year;
          I had a rare week of free time and enthusiastically accepted the offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our team consisted of two artists, a sound designer/musician, and myself as a programmer.
          We deliberated on what our game would be before the beginning of the development window,
          and decided that a game with drawing as a central mechanic would be interesting to see.
          This directly led to the concept of having the game resemble a Nintendo DS game, working within its design
          limitations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Touhou Fan Game Jam 11 was a "day of theme" jam, where the game jam's theme would be revealed at the start of
          the jam window.
          This theme was Immortality. The team convened to plan out more of our game, and we eventually decided to
          create a game
          where two immortals engage in battle while the player recorded their attack patterns, to "immortalize" their
          fight.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          With our concept firmly established, the first thing I set out to do was figure out how to register player
          input through drawing.
          I write about this process <a href="/projects/DollarOne.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This experiment proved highly successful, providing a solid foundation upon which we could build the rest of
          the game by hooking into its systems as a base, and by the end of day one we had input recognition,
          along with a template saving and loading system. This system allowed other team members to add additional
          patterns to help improve detection.
        </p>
        <p>
          After implementation, I had a much deeper understanding of how images (specifically image manipulation) in
          Unity worked.
        </p>
        <span><img src="/img/Coloures.gif"></span>
        <p>
          The start of day two was spent trying to implement a dialogue system. I ended up leaving this by the wayside
          to work on more gameplay-critical systems, and sadly never got the chance to return to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I ended up doing next though was quite important for the game to work, the actual patterns players needed
          to draw. Luckily my new experience with images in Unity inspired a clever approach to streamline the
          process. Instead of manually coding each pattern, we could use images as templates for bullet spawn locations.
          This allowed us to use image editors to effortlessly create new bullet patterns. Because of the limited time
          we had to work on this project, this was a great boon.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I approached next was the bullet-pattern firing system. Our immortal warriors had to fire "danmaku"
          (a term referring both to the subgenre of shoot-'em-up games focusing on complex bullet patterns as well as
          the bullet patterns themselves)
          for the player to draw.
          Luckily, my new experience with images in Unity inspired a quick-to-implement approach.
          Instead of manually coding each pattern, we used images as templates for bullet spawn locations.
          This allowed us to use image editors to effortlessly create new bullet patterns, greatly streamlining the
          process of adding gameplay variety.
        </p>
        <span><img src="/img/Fight.gif"></span>
        <p>
          The rest of day two was largely spent polishing this system, making sure the correct bullets were recognized,
          clearing the bullets of the drawn patterns, adding the assets the artists were working on, and adding
          particles.
          By the end of day two, we had a mostly working main game!
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>
          Day 3 was spent on adding additional mechanics while the artists and musician added their assets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mechanics-wise, I added a dynamic difficulty system, where the game's difficulty increases the longer you
          don't get hit,
          a bomb system, which allowed you to clear the screen and reset the difficulty a limited amount of times when
          overwhelmed,
          a dynamic music system, where the music would change along with the game's difficulty,
          and a change to the menu so you had to circle menu options to select them, which was surprisingly difficult to
          implement.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of this would make it into the initial jam release of the game.

        <p>
          Overall, I am still quite happy with this version of the game, especially considering it was made in a very
          short timeframe. However, I still went back a week later to add some frequently requested features (like
          score) and to
          overhaul the overall balance of the game. The post-jam version of NDS is now a fun, surprisingly addictive
          game.
        </p>
        <p>
          In doing this, I also found a reason to finally experiment with something: adding WiiMote support! Now, this
          wasn't exactly something anyone *wanted*, but for me this was a great opportunity to finally try implementing
          it.
          I ended up using an <a href="https://github.com/Flafla2/Unity-Wiimote">API from 2015</a> to do so.
          Figuring out how to connect a WiiMote to a PC in 2023 and learning how to use the API took some
          time, but I couldn't be happier with the results!
