          Hieda no Akyuu's Nocturnal Discordant Symposium is a game made in 72 hours for the Touhou Fan Game Jam 11.
          Where it won first place in the concept category and 9th over all.

          I was the lead (and only) programmer on this project, collaborating with three individuals spanning different
          parts of the world.

        <p>
          This project originated because an American friend of mine asked if I wanted to join their team for a gamejam.
          We had been discussing the idea of participating in a game jam together for about a year, and finally, I had a
          week of free time, so I enthusiastically accepted the invitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our team consisted of two artists, myself as a programmer, and a sound designer. We decided on having drawing
          as
          our central mechanic rather quickly which eventually led to the concept of having the game resemble a
          Nintendo DS and working with its limitations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, the jamtheme ended up being revealed as immortality inspiring us to create a game where two immortals
          engage in battle while the player must record the patterns of their attacks to "commemorate" their
          confrontation.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          With our concept firmly established the first thing I set out to do was figuring out how to register player
          input through drawing. Which I go further into <a href="/projects/DollarOne.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This experiment proved highly successful providing a solid foundation upon which we could build the rest of
          the game by hooking
          into its systems as a base. And by the end of day one we had input recignition, a template saving and loading
          system that made it straightforward to add additional patterns drawn by different team members to catch more
          obscure ways of drawing stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of day one, I had a much deeper unerstanding of how images and more specifically image manipulation
          in Unity worked.
        </p>
        <span><img src="/img/Coloures.gif"></span>
        <p>
          The start of day two was spent trying to implement a dialogue system which I ended up putting by the wayside
          to focus on finishing the game and which I sadly never got the chance to return to.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I ended up doing next though was quite important for the game to work, the actual patterns players needed
          to draw. Luckily my new experience with images in Unity gave inspired a clever approach to streamline the
          process. Instead of manually coding each pattern, we could use images as templates for bullet spawn locations.
          This allowed us to use image editors to effortlessly create new bullet patterns. Because of the limited time
          we had to work on this project this was a great boon.
        </p>
        <span><img src="/img/Fight.gif"></span>
        <p>
          The rest of day two was spent mostly polishing up this sytem, making sure the correct bullets were recognised
          and if they were they would be destroyed, adding the art the artists were working on, adding particles and so
          on and so forth. Until eventually by the end of day two we had a working main mechanic!
        </p>
        <span><video width="560" height="315" controls src="/img/Day2.mp4"></span>
        <br>
        <p>
          Day 3 was spent on adding additional mechanics and adding all of the art and music the rest of the team had
          been working on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mechanics wise I added everything from a health system that linked into the game speed changing depending on
          how long you could go without getting hit, the music changing the longer one kept going. A bomb system which
          allowed you to clear the screen a limited amount of times if stuff got overwhelming. And making it so you
          could circle things on the menu to select them which was surprisingly hard to figure out.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of this culminated in the eventual jam version of the game.

        <p>
          Overall I am still quite happy with this version of the game, especially cosidering it was made in a very
          short timeframe. One thing you might notice is that this is not the same version of the game which is online
          now, that's because I went back a week later to add some frequently requested features like score and to
          overhaul the overall balance of the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          In doing this I also found a reason to finally experiment with something, adding WiiMote support. Now, this
          wasn't exactly something anyone wanted but for me this was a great opportunity to finally dig my teeth into
          it. I ended up using an <a href="https://github.com/Flafla2/Unity-Wiimote">API from 2015</a> to do so. Both
          figuring out how to connect a WiiMote to a pc in 2023 and learning how to then use the API correctly took some
          time and effort but I couldn't be happier with the results!
