          mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be

          When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of
          the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw
          myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown
          plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with
          the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who
          formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats
          around us in an eternity of blist.
