    <h3>
      Programmer | Game Developer <br>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Bas, and I study game development at <a
        href="https://www.digitalartsandentertainment.be/">Digital Arts and Entertainment</a>.<br>
      My passion for game design lies chiefly in the gritty aspects of creation - namely, the programming of systems and
      gameplay, along with a lesser experience in engine programming. My expertise is primarily with C++ and C#, and
      though I would appreciate a position that allows me to execute on that expertise, I find that any position that
      requires gameplay programming would be the best fit. <br>
      I'm seeking to both broaden my horizon with new experiences while also lending my current expertise to those who
      can best utilize it. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope you have a wonderful day.
      <br>
      <br>
      In my free time I enjoy TTRPGS, writing and making pictures out of tiny squares.
